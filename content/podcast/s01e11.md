In this eleventh episode Ezra and Peter discuss the June Community Update and interview content creator Linux Lounge! They also discuss (your) community feedback and questions!

## What have we been up to lately?

* Ezra:
  * is releasing a [game](https://gamejolt.com/games/Televoid_out_of_the_loop/377460)!
    * Itâ€™s nearly done! It should be released June 22nd if no serious issues arise. Otherwise, shortly after.
    * The game is, of course, open source. So, you can make fun of my horrifying code.
    * Itâ€™s a mysterious adventure filled with a handful of minigames, a short story and minimal moon logic.
    * Itâ€™s called "Televoid: Out of The Loop" and is a fangame for a show I enjoy: [Televoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhU-0YgDyJY&list=PL290QH8A1p-SdZ54seS-LG_4G0AyDoXzG), an online series staring Ian MacLeod on his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/brutalmoose). To show our appreciation of this amazing series, some fans and I got together to make this game.
    * Itâ€™s pretty much consumed my life these past few weeksâ€¦
    * After the released, I might have some fun and see if I canâ€™t port it to the pinephone, for the giggles. otherwiseâ€¦
  * Iâ€™ve also been back on the video making train!
    * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLN0SPhQo4jAPpTFNsxUnMg),
    * [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@Elatronion:a).
* Peter:
  * [wrote a bad blog post because of having had a PinePhone for a year](https://linmob.net/my-first-year-with-the-pinephone/),
  * [GloDroid video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdmBq0rFPa8),
  * has written the 50th installment of [LinBits, the weekly update on all things Linux Phones](https://linmob.net/linbits-49-weekly-linux-phone-news-week23-24/) in between recording and publication of this episode.

#### @PitrusCitrus@mastodon.social asks

_Question to the both of you @talkpine. What is a project you want to see on the pinephone that can be realistically done by a beginner programmer whoâ€™s looking to get their hands dirty and expand their skillset? Be it practical, cool or just plain fun, throw us some ideas!_ See [here](https://mastodon.social/@PitrusCitrus/106355073466197926)
