## Quartz64-Zero

The **Quartz64-Zero** SBC is featuring the Rockchip RK3566T SoC in a smaller PCB form factor. This SoC combines a quad-core, ARM Cortex-A55 1.6GHz CPU with a Mali-G52-2EE GPU. It is capable of driving a single 4K display at 60fps and the GPU uses the open source Panfrost driver. It also has the benefit of running very cool, even without a heatsink and under a sustained load. This SBC is equipped with 1GB LPDDR4 system memory, an optional eMMC module (up to 128GB) and microSD slot for booting. The board is equipped with a Wifi/BT with flex antenna, a custom PCIe connector, an USB 3.0 type A host port, as well as many other peripheral device interfaces such as UART, SPI, I2C, for makers to integrate with sensors and other peripherals.

The Quartz64-Zero is a low cost board suitable for various commercial project application and guarantee supply at least until year 2028. Commercial order can customize the Quartz64-Zero board (without PCB change request) per their requirement (such as different DRAM Capacity, on-board eMMC, staff Ethernet Port) and MoQ:2000 apply.

Note: Power Adapter requirement: 5V 3A type H 3.5mm OD/1.35mm ID barrel type DC Jack Power Supply
