## An Open Source Smartphone Supported by All Major Linux Phone Projects

The **PinePhone** is a smartphone that empowers users with control over the device. It is capable of running mainline Linux, features hardware privacy switches, and is designed for open-source enthusiasts. Powered by the same quad-core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit SoC used in our popular PINE A64 Single Board Computer, the PinePhone runs mainline Linux as well as anything else you’ll get it to run. 

The purpose of the PinePhone isn’t only to deliver a functioning Linux phone to end-users, but also to actively create a market for such a device, as well as to support existing and well established Linux-on-Phone projects. All major Linux Phone-oriented projects, as well as other free and open source operating systems, are represented on the PinePhone and developers work together on our platform to bring support to this community-driven device.
