## PinePower, A 65W GaN Power Supply

The portable PinePower packs plenty of power in a very compact design. It is capable of powering or charging multiple PINE64 devices; such as the Pinebook Pro, PinePhone and the PineTime simultaneously. If you’re interested in getting the Pinecil, our soldering iron, then we highly recommend the PinePower to ensure optimal power delivery.
