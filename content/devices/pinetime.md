## An Open Source Smartwatch For Your Favorite Devices. Low Cost, High Fidelity.

The **PineTime** is a free and open source smartwatch capable of running custom-built open operating systems. Some of the notable features include a heart rate monitor, a week-long battery, and a capacitive touch IPS display that is legible in direct sunlight. It is a fully community driven side-project which anyone can contribute to, allowing you to keep control of your device.

We envision the PineTime as a companion for not only your PinePhone but also for your favorite devices — any phone, tablet, or even PC. In its current state the PineTime ships with a community firmware called Infinitime, which works with Linux computers and phones, Windows machines, and Android devices. IOS support is currently being looked into for Infinitime.
