## 1. Presentation and typography

The original logotype uses Arial Std Narrow Regular, but an acceptable and frequently used variant is written in Noto Sans Telugu UI.

Other colour variations are also permitted for non-commercial use. Other variants than the official logotype may be used for commercial use following an inquiry with PINE64 Community representatives and/ or designated Pine Store Ltd. staff members.

### 1.1. Slogan(s), look and branding

The PINE64 community slogan is “Open. Friendly. Community Driven”.
PINE64 hardware packaging uses the tagline “Open Sesame”.

PINE64 uses a distinct brand look which makes use of the original colour scheme of the pine cone logo (see section 1.) in conjunction with black, grey and white as background colours.
The distinct look of PINE64 organization’s (pine64.org) website, the official forum (forum.pine64.org) and the Pine Store’s (pine64.com) website is restricted to official PINE64 portals and community services. It may not be copied or imitated by community run services such as forums or websites.

### 1.2. PINE64 logo kit

We provide a PINE64 logo media kit in .zip format containing a range of acceptable logo variations in SVG file format.
The .zip file also contains a READ ME document with detailed information and instructions.

### 1.3. Branding on devices

We choose to keep PINE64 branding on our devices to a minimum. Our design follows our inherent ideology that devices we sell belong to the end-users, not to us.

A PINE64 pinecone is always printed on the PCB of a single board computer or device, alongside with the hardware’s name and revision number version. The full brand name is never used on our devices.

The PINE64 pinecone is also discreetly placed between the torch and camera on the PinePhone, on the LCD of the PineTab and on the SUPER key on the Pinebook Pro. This minimal branding aesthetic will also be used for future PINE64 hardware.

Packaging of PINE64 devices varies in branding implementation, ranging from plain white boxes from recycled materials to the hallmark “Open Sesame” tagline alongside PINE64 logotype from recycled cardboard.
The PinePhone also uses a distinct “PINEPHONE” logotype written in Good Times Regular font.
