The **SOPINE Baseboard Model A** is a baseboard that hosts the [SOPINE A64 Compute Module](/documentation/SOPINE) and turns it into a full single board computer. Makers can use this baseboard as reference to develop their own PCBs and for software development during early stages for custom hardware or PCB development.
