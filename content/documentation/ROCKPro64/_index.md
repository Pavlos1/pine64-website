The **ROCKPro64** is the most powerful single-board computer released by PINE64. It is powered by a Rockchip RK3399 hexa-core (dual ARM Cortex A72 and quad ARM Cortex A53) 64-bit processor with a Mali T-860 quad-core GPU. The key features include a PCI Express (PCIe) x4 open-ended slot, the use of LPDDR4 DRAM, and industry-standard heatsink mounting holes.

The ROCKPro64 is equipped with 2 or 4&nbsp;GB of LPDDR4 system memory, and 128&nbsp;Mb of SPI boot flash. There is also an optional eMMC module (up to 128&nbsp;GB) and microSD slot for booting. The board is equipped with 1x USB 3.0 Type-C host port with DP 1.2, 1x USB 3.0 Type-A host port, 2x USB 2.0 host port, Gigabit Ethernet, PI-2 GPIO bus, MiPi DSI interface, eDP interface, touch panel interface, stereo MiPi CSI interface, as well as many other device interfaces such as UART, SPI, I<sup>2</sup>C, for makers to integrate with sensors and other peripherals. Many different operating systems (OSes) are freely available from the open-source community, such as Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Arch), BSD and Android.
