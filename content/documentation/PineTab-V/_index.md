The _PineTab-V_ is _PINE64â€™s_ first RISC-V tablet. It is based on the JH7110 64-bit RISC-V SoC.

## Introduction

In late 2022, PINE64 announced plans to help grow the RISC-V hardware ecosystem alongside the existing ARM-based device line-up. The PineTab-V is an experimental device, which ships without an OS and without any promises. The JH7110 RISC-V SoC, and the RISC-V architecture in more general, is currently best described as having limited Linux support. You can think of it as a convenient development platform targeted at those of you interested in bringing Linux support to JH7110 and, by extension, the entire RISC-V ecosystem.
