The StarPro64 is a RISC-V single-board computer from PINE64, featuring the EIC7700X SoC with a CPU speed of 1.8 GHz and NPU performance of 19.95 TOPS. It retains the model-A board format, similar to the Star64, with dual Ethernet ports, digital video output, USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports, a full GPIO header, and a 4x PCIe lane. Available in 8GB, 16GB, or 32GB LPDDR5 RAM configurations, the StarPro64 aims to support a range of affordable RISC-V devices and is currently in the prototyping phase, with developer units expected soon.
