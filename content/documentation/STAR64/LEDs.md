The LEDs can be configured to stop blinking. Under Linux this can be done using the following command (as root):

```shell
echo "default-on" > /sys/devices/platform/leds/leds/blue-led/trigger
```

To list possible other triggers for the blue LED:

```shell
cat /sys/devices/platform/leds/leds/blue-led/trigger 
```

An example for a trigger is _activity_, where the the blue LED reflects the CPU activity.
