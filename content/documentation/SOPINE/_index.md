The **SOPINE** is a compute module powered by the same quad-core ARM Cortex A53 64-bit processor used in the PINE A64 with 2&nbsp;GB of LPDDR3 RAM memory, power management unit, SPI flash and integrated bootable microSD slot. The module features a SODIMM-DDR3 form-factor and can be paired with either the [SOPINE Baseboard](/documentation/SOPINE_Baseboard), the [Clusterboard](/documentation/Clusterboard) or a custom host PCB for industrial or other embedded applications.

The SOPINE module has a five-year LTS (long-term supply) status, which means that it will be supplied to 2022 at the very least. There is a one-year warranty period for the SOPINE module. It is fully compatible with the PINE A64-LTS in terms of software support
