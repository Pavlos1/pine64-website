## Dimensions

Board dimensions: 85mm x 56mm x 18.8mm

## Power

Input power: DC 5V @ 3A, 3.5mm OD/ 1.35mm ID DC jack connector

## Video

* Digital Video 4KP60 (Type A - full)

## Audio

* 3.5mm stereo earphone/microphone plug

## Network

* 10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet
* WiFi 802.11 b/g/n/ac with Bluetooth 4.0/4.1
* MHF1 RF coaxial connector for external BT/wifi antenna

## Storage

* microSD - bootable, support SDHC and SDXC, storage up to 256GB
* USB -	1 USB3.0 Host port and 2 USB2.0 Host port

## Expansion Ports
