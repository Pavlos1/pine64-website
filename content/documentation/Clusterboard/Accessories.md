* To operate this board you will need a power supply, Pine advises a "5V 15A power supply with 6.3mm OD/3.0mm ID barrel type DC Jack" which is also available in the store ([EU](https://pine64.com/product/clusterboard-eu-power-supply/) / [US](https://pine64.com/product/clusterboard-us-power-supply/) versions). There are other ways to power this board, but they are not described here yet.
* The board works best when it is protected by a (mITX)case, and has some airflow provided by a fan.
* Each SOPINE module can use cooling, both by a casefan, and by using heatsinks on the individual modules. At least the A64 could use some cooling.
* The first slot can use a eMMC module, which are in the store in [16GB](https://pine64.com/product/16gb-emmc-module/) / [32GB](https://pine64.com/product/32gb-emmc-module/) / [64GB](https://pine64.com/product/64gb-emmc-module/) / [128GB](https://pine64.com/product/128gb-emmc-module/) sizes. The modules can be used as a USB stick using a [USB adapter](https://pine64.com/product/usb-adapter-for-emmc-module/). (The eMMC is also readable with the Hardkernel [eMMC to microSD](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/emmc-module-reader-board-for-os-upgrade/) converter.)
* Two AA batteries, to allow the SOPINE nodes to retain the RTC (Real Time Clock) time and date information when the power is disconnected.
