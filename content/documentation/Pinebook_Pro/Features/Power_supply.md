* Input Power: 5V DC, 15W (current limit 3A)
* Mechanical: 3.5mm OD / 1.35mm ID, Barrel jack
* USB-C 5V, 12.5W (current limit is at 2.5A regardless of the USB PD negotiations result)
* Only use one power input at a time, barrel jack OR USB-C (note: some powerful Type-C adapters have rather limited current for 5 V operation, and e.g. 2 A wonâ€™t be enough to run the system and charge the battery at the same time, so check the specs)
