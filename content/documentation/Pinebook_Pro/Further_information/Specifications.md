Based on Rockchip RK3399

## CPU Architecture

big.LITTLE architecture: Dual Cortex-A72 + Quad Cortex-A53, 64-bit CPU

* Full implementation of the ARM architecture v8-A instruction set (both AArch64 and AArch32)
* ARM Neon Advanced SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) support for accelerated media and signal processing computation
* ARMv8 Cryptography Extensions
* VFPv4 floating point unit supporting single and double-precision operations
* Hardware virtualization support
* TrustZone technology support
* Full CoreSight debug solution
* One isolated voltage domain to support DVFS

Cortex-A72 (big cluster):

* [Dual-core Cortex-A72 up to 2.0GHz CPU](https://developer.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-a/cortex-a72)
* Superscalar, variable-length, out-of-order pipeline
* L1 cache 48KB Icache and 32KB Dcache for each A72
* L2 cache 1024KB for big cluster

Cortex-A53 (little cluster):

* [Quad-core Cortex-A53 up to 1.5GHz CPU](https://developer.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-a/cortex-a53)
* In-order pipeline with symmetric dual-issue of most instructions
* L1 cache 32KB Icache and 32KB Dcache for each A53
* L2 cache 512KB for little cluster

Cortex-M0 (control processors):

* [Cortex-M0 CPU](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m0)
* Two Cortex-M0 cooperate with the central processors
* Architecture: Armv6-M
* Thumb/Thumb2 instruction set
* 32 bit only

## GPU Architecture

* [ARM Mali-T860MP4 Quad-core GPU](https://developer.arm.com/products/graphics-and-multimedia/mali-gpus/mali-t860-and-mali-t880-gpus)
* The highest performance GPUs built on Arm Mali’s famous Midgard architecture, the Mali-T860 GPU is designed for complex graphics use cases and provide stunning visuals for UHD content.
* Frequency 650MHz
* Throughput 1300Mtri/s, 10.4Gpix/s

Graphic interface standards:

* OpenGL® ES 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2. (Panfrost has initial support of 3.0 beginning 2020/02/27)
* Vulkan 1.0, using the Mali binary blob. (Panfrost does not support Vulkan as of 2020/06/24)
* OpenCL™ 1.1, 1.2
* DirectX® 11 FL11_1
* RenderScript™

## System Memory

RAM Memory:

* LPDDR4
* 800MHz, (limited by RK3399)
* Dual memory channels on the CPU, each 32 bits wide
* Quad memory channels on the RAM chip, each 16 bits wide, 2 bonded together for each CPU channel
* 4GB as a single 366 pin mobile RAM chip

Storage Memory:

* 64GB eMMC module, can be upgraded to an 128GB eMMC module. (The initial PINE64 community build version shipped with a 128GB eMMC.)
* eMMC version 5.1, HS400, 8 bit on RK3399 side
* Bootable

SPI flash:

* [SPI](/documentation/Pinebook_Pro/Features/SPI)
* 128Mbit / 16MByte
* 1 bit interface
* Bootable, (first boot device, ahead of eMMC & SD card)
* U-Boot images can be made to work, but as of 2020/06/24 there is no standardized image available.

## Video out

* USB-C Alt mode DP
* Up to 3840x2160 p60, dependant on adapter, (2 lanes verses 4 lanes)

## Expansion Ports

MicroSD card:

* Bootable
* Supports SD, SDHC and SDXC cards, up to 512GB tested. SDXC standard says 2TB is the maximum.
* Version SD3.0, (MMC 4.5), up to 50MB/s
* SD card Application Performance Class 1 (A1), (or better), recommended by some users, for better IOPS

USB ports:

* 1 x USB 2.0 Type-A Host Port, bootable
* 1 x USB 3.0 Type-A Host Port, 5Gbps, is not bootable
* 1 x USB 3.0 Type-C OTG Port, 5Gbps, (includes laptop charging function), is not bootable
* Note that high power USB devices may not work reliably on a PBP. Or they may draw enough power to drain the battery even when the PBP is plugged into A.C. One alternative is externally powered USB devices.
