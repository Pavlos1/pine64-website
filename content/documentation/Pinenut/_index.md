The **PineNut** is an attempt for an open source Wi-Fi and BLE module for PINE64 devices.

The Pinenut-01S module offers a complete and self-contained Wi-Fi and BLE networking solution, allowing it to either host the application or to offload all Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networking functions to another application processor.
