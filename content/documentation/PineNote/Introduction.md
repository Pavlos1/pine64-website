## State of the software

The PineNote is based on the in 2021 released Rockchip RK3566 SoC. The upstreaming status of the SoC functionality can be found on the [Quartz64 development](/documentation/Quartz64/Development#upstreaming_status) documentation page of the Quartz64 single-board computer using the same SoC. In the [PineNote development](/documentation/PineNote/Development/#mainline_development) documentation page you’ll find the items specific for the PineNote.

The community edition batch of the PineNote is aimed solely at users with extensive Linux experience. The software while it has improved is still prone to software breaking issues, so users must be prepared to get their hands dirty. This batch is suitable for taking notes, reading ebooks and documents, and general tasks such as web browsing.

The current default Debian firmware is available for users to download [here](https://github.com/PNDeb/pinenote-debian-image/releases). All core features works well out of the box (taking notes, reading ebooks and documents) but there are still some issues that arise due to updates from Debian (Trixie) testing.
