The **SOEDGE Baseboard** is a baseboard that hosts the [SOEDGE](/documentation/SOEDGE) compute module and turns it into a full single board computer. Makers can use this baseboard as reference to develop their own PCBs and for software development during early stages for custom hardware or PCB development.
