SOEDGE module together with the baseboard certification:

* Disclaimer: Please note that SOEDGE module is not a "final" product and in general certification is not necessary. However, SOEDGE module still submits the mpdel A baseboard for FCC, CE, and ROHS certifications and obtain the certificates to prove that can pass the testing. Please note, a final commercial product needs to perform its own testing and obtain its own certificate.
