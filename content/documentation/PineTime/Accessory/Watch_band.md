The PineTime uses a standard 20mm watch band / strap. There is a [thread](https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=9392&pid=81902) in the forum discussing this.

Due to the watches design. Retention for the spring bars are recessed into the watch. Not all 20mm bands / straps work. This is especially the case for Nato style bands / straps being too thick.
