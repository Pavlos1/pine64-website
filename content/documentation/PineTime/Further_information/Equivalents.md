This page contains a list of PineTime hardware equivalents or very close clones. Primarily to keep track of which devices could possibly be "jailbroken" and run PineTime firmware.

Please add devices that use the same chipset to this list.

## Kalakate

Seems to be PineTime hardware, interesting GUI, seems DaFit-y

## Colmi P8

A few firmware already support both the P8 and PineTime, the physical differences are minor - only a few MCU pins are mapped differently. There are a few open issues on InfiniTimeâ€™s GitHub page to add support for this device.
