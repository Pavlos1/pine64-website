Certifications:

* Disclaimer: Please note that PINE64 SBC is not a "final" product and in general certification is not necessary. However, PINE64 still submit the SBC for FCC and CE certification and obtain the certificates to proof that SBC board is capable on passing the testing. Please note a final commercial product needs to performs its owns testing and obtains its owns certificates.
* [Quartz64 model-A CE Certificate](https://files.pine64.org/doc/cert/Quartz64%20Model-A%20CE%20certification-S21051101701001.pdf)
* [Quartz64 model-A FCC Certificate](https://files.pine64.org/doc/cert/Quartz64%20Model-A%20FCC%20certification-S21051101702001.pdf)

## Model "B"

Model "B" Baseboard Dimensions: 85mm x 56mm x 18.8mm

Input Power: DC 5V @ 3A 3.5mmOD/1.35mmID center-positive Barrel DC Jack connector

Quartz64 Model "B" SBC Schematic and PCB Board Resource:

* [Quartz64 Model "B" SBC Schematic ver 1.3 20220124 PDF file](https://files.pine64.org/doc/quartz64/Quartz64_model-B_Schematic-V1.3_20220124.pdf)
* [Quartz64 Model "B" SBC PCB Connector placement PDF file](https://files.pine64.org/doc/quartz64/Quartz64_model-B_PCB_Components_Placement-V1.2_20211014.pdf)
* Please note that v1.2 and V1.3 schematic and component placement are identical, just some component value changed.
* Note: Model B uses a Molex PicoBlade compatible connector for the RTC battery. The Pine64 Backup Battery Holders come with a JST PH type connector. To use the Pine64 RTC Backup Battery Holder, the connector on the battery holder will need to be modified with a PicoBlade type connector.
