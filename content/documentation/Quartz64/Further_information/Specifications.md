* Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n/ac with Bluetooth 5.0 (optional on model A, built in on model B)

## Storage

* microSD - bootable, supports SDHC and SDXC, storage up to 2TB
* USB
  * Model A: 2 USB 2.0 host ports, 1 USB 2.0 OTG port, 1 USB 3.0 host port
  * Model B: 1 USB 2.0 host port, 1 USB 2.0 OTG port, 1 USB 3.0 host port
* one native SATA 3.0 6Gb/s Port (only on model A, shared with USB 3.0 host port) (removed in newer revisions due to electrical signalling issues it caused)
* optional eMMC module from 8GB up to 128GB
* 64 Mbit (8 MByte) SPI flash (Model B only), part number **25Q64DWZPIG** in the schematic

### eMMC Speeds

On a 64 GB eMMC module:

```console
$ sudo hdparm -tT /dev/mmcblk1
```

    /dev/mmcblk1:
     Timing cached reads:   2368 MB in  2.00 seconds = 1184.46 MB/sec
     Timing buffered disk reads: 452 MB in  3.01 seconds = 149.98 MB/sec

## Expansion Ports

* HDMI
* eDP - 4 lanes of 2.7Gbps, up to 2560x1600@60Hz (only on model A)
* DSI - Display Serial Interface, 4 lanes MiPi, up to 1440P on model A, 2 lanes MiPi, up to 1080p on model B
* CSI - CMOS Camera Interface, 4 lanes MiPi up to 8 mega pixel on model A, 2 lanes MiPi up to 5 mega pixel on model B
* TP - Touch Panel Port, SPI with interrupt on model A
* RTC - Real Time Clock Battery Connector
* VBAT - Lithium Battery Connector with temperature sensor input on model A
* Wi-Fi/BT Module Header - SDIO 3.0 and UART on model A, built-in Wi-Fi/BT Module on model B
* 2x20 pins "Pi2" GPIO Header on model B, 2x10 pins GPO header on model A
* PCIe x4 open ended slot on model A, m.2 slot on model B, one Gen2 lane due to SoC constraints
  * On Model A, the slot provides 10W of power for the 3.3V supply and however much power your 12V input power supply provides on the 12V supply

The PCIe implementation on the RK3566 is much more compatible with a wide range of devices compared to the one on the RK3399 used on the ROCKPro64. This means a lot more devices should work (excluding dGPUs due to a lack of cache snooping ability).

### Combo PHYs

![width=400](/documentation/images/rk3566_phy.png)

Several of the I/O options on the RK3566 used in the Quartz64 are using the same I/O lines, meaning that they cannot be used at the same time. The above diagram illustrates how they are connected.

In particular, USB 3.0 and the SATA connector on the board are mutually exclusive, and the PCI-e 2.0 lane can be reconfigured into a second SATA port, though an adapter cable needs to be fashioned for this to be useful.

## GPIO Pins (Quartz64 Model A)

Attention! GPIOs are 3.3V!
