Note: Please expand this section with more cases known to work.

## Model "A"

All enclosures that fit the ROCKPro64 should fit the Quartz64 Model "A", as the I/O has been laid out the same on purpose.

* [Model A Acrylic Open Enclosure](/documentation/Accessories/Cases/Model_A_Acrylic_Open_Enclosure) - but see the troubleshooting section below.
* [RockPro64 Premium Aluminium Case](/documentation/Quartz64/Accessories/Premium_aluminium_case)
* [ROCKPro64](/documentation/ROCKPro64/Hardware/3D_printable_ITX_mounting_brackets/) (Not an enclosure but allows to mount the board in an ATX/ITX case)

## Model "B"

* [Model B Acrylic Open Enclosure](/documentation/Accessories/Cases/Model_B_Acrylic_Open_Enclosure)
* the ROCK64 aluminium enclosure **does not** work, as the DC input jack is placed differently
