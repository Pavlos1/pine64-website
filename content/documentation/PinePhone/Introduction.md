The PinePhone is not a regular phone and you might not get the latest and greatest hardware and this years' newest innovation. You will get a device with good mainline support with a great community behind it.

## State of the software

First things first, the PinePhone is aimed solely at early adopters - more specifically, the units are solely intended to find their way into the hands of users with extensive operating system experience.

Bear in mind that the software for these smartphones is very early, with most of the software being in alpha or beta state. That’s especially also the case for scalability of applications, their availability and practicability, any hardware function implementations and the firmware. The software is provided as is. There is no warranty for the software, not even for merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

If you have any questions regarding the current state of the software or of specific features working, please don’t hesitate to ask in the community chat (see [Main Page](/documentation))!

## Help and support

Still have any questions regarding software, shipping, or ordering after reading this wiki? Please don’t hesitate to contact the community in the bridged community channels for detailed answers or simply to chat with friendly people in the community! See [Main Page](/documentation).

Please keep in mind that PINE64 is not like a regular company (see the [PINE64 philosophy](https://www.pine64.org/community/philosophy/)) and that support resources are limited - the best way to get support quickly is to ask in the community chat! Please only contact the PINE64 support directly if questions couldn’t be solved via the community chat or this wiki.
